> 此前，一位学生在食堂买到的猪脚饭中吃出疑似老鼠头的物体，被食堂工作人员、学校官方和食品监管部门同时认定为鸭脖。

究竟是鼠头还是鸭脖，我没有下结论的权利，因为互联网不是法外之地。我只想问一个句：
> 为什么不能是猪脚？

这场争论本身，就已经是个问题。这就好比争论“老李的儿子到底是老张的还是老王的”一样。在我看来，猪脚饭里应该只能吃出猪脚。

有没有可能是猪脚？有可能。有没有可能是鸭脖？有可能。有没有可能是鼠头？也有可能。可为什么区别如此之大的三样东西会存在如此大的争论。我猜是因为在后续的检验开始前，证据已经被扔了。一旦销毁证据，则死无对证。

> 如果犯罪现场的鞋印不是你的，你为什么要烧掉你所有的鞋？

假设不明物体是前两者，则真相对食堂有利，他们尽力保留证据来消除误会；假设是后者，销毁证据则可以完全避免被确认为鼠头。

> 疑似恶性肿瘤总比确诊恶性肿瘤要好。

这个事件背后的本质是公信力缺失。现在官方陷入了一种不论怎么说话，说真话还是假话，民众都不信的地步。没有什么比失去信用更可怕的了。这背后的问题令人深思。

我不能再说什么了。只是还想再问一句：

> 老鼠的身子哪去了？

## English edition:

# Pig's Feet, Duck’s Neck, and Mouse’s Head

> Previously, a student found an object like a head of mice in a dish of pig’s foot rice. The canteen, school, and food regulatory department officials considered the object a duck’s neck.

Ultimately, I have no privilege to say what it is because the Internet is not the world outside of the law of certain country. I want to ask:

> Why cannot it be a pig’s foot?

The dispute itself has been a problem. This is just like disputing whether Mr.Li’s son is Mr.Zhang’s or Mr.Wang’s. In my opinion, in a pig’s feet rice,  what should be found are only the pig’s feet.

Can it be a pig’s foot? Yes. Can it be a duck’s neck? Certainly. Can it be a mouse’s head? Yes, maybe. But why there is such a big disputation on these three obviously different things? I guess before the subsequent checking work, the object has been destroyed. Once the evidence is destroyed, the situation turns into the status of dead men telling no tales.

> Why you burnt all of your shoes if the shoe print is not yours at the crime scene?

The truth will benefit the canteen if the unknown object is any of the first two. They will preserve the evidence which can be used to clear misreading. If it is the last one, destroying the evidence can prevent it from being considered as mouse’s head.

> Being suspected as malignancy is always better than being confirmed.

The essence of the disputation is the lack of credibility. Nowadays, officials get into a situation that whatever the claim and whether the information they claim is true or false, nobody believes. Nothing terrible than lost credit. The problem behind deserves deep thinking.


I cannot write anything. Again, I want to ask:

> Where the body of the mouse went to?
