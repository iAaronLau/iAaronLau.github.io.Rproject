> 我死给你看。

有人如果想威胁别人满足他的某些条件，就会说这句话。我们都知道这种威胁手段只对关心他的人有效。但由于这句话看起来很有威胁性，它就被滥用了。

比如讨薪。如果这发生在工作单位，也许会有效。这是因为老板只是害怕讨薪者在他的地盘上出事。
以死相逼几乎是一个错误的策略。关心你的人不会让事情恶化到这个地步，不关心你的人根本不会在意这种威胁。

正确的做法是当坏事发生的时候冷静下来。通过诉诸法律来索取诉求（无理要求除外）。即便是法律帮不上忙，也不要以死相逼。记住一个原则：你自己是你自己的最大的利益维护者，只要还活着，事情就有可能转好。


## English edition:

# Threating Others By Damage Self

> I will sucide/jump if you ...

There are always some people who say this sentence if he want to threaten someone else to fulfill his some conditions. We all agree that this threatening method works on the people who care about him. But because this phrase seems so threatening, it has been abused. 

For example, asking for wages. Maybe it would work if this happened in the workplace. This is because the boss fears the demonstrator died on his territory.

Threatening with suicide is almost a wrong strategy. The people who care about you would not let the situation degrade to this point, and those who do not care about you would not care about this type of threat.

The right thing is to calm down when something bad happens. By accessing to justice to claim the needs (except for unreasonable requests). Even if the justice cannot help, do not threaten with suicide. Remember one basic concept: yourself is the best interest defender for yourself, and only when you are alive things have the possibility to turn good.
