Hi there. I have a master's degree now and am seeking a Ph.D. position. My research topic is the detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) based on OCTA images, and I am proficient in computer-aided image analysis and application programming. I am glad to connect with you at any time.

### EDUCATION  
- __M.S. in Electronic and Information Engineering__  
Wenzhou Medical University; — 2021-2024, GPA: 3.5/4.0
Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, CAS; — 2021-2024

- __B.S. in Software Engineering__  
Hebei University of Science and Technology; — 2017-2021

### RESEARCH & PROJECTS 
- __Regional Relation Model for EOAD/MCI Detection Based on OCTA (PolarNet+) 2023-2024__  
The extension of the Polar-Net. By serializing the images into sequences in three directions and seeing the sequences as nodes to construct a graph, this work enhances the interpretability.

- __Multilevel Graph Representation Model for AD/MCI Detection (Eye-AD) 2022-2023__  
Proposed a graph model using multilevel representation, which utilizes the intra- and inter-instance relationships of different features in the retinal OCTA images.

- __Clinical-Friendly OCTA-based AD Detection Model (Polar-Net) 2021-2022__  
Proposed a method that follows the clinical analysis method for AD, improving the interpretability of the model. The region-based importance map provides a new AD research view. [Source](https://github.com/iMED-Lab/Polar-Net-Pytorch).

- __Three-dimensional Reconstruction System Based on Laser Radar 2020-2021__  
Developed a plugin for CloudCompare to realize real-time capture for buildings using laser radar. Meanwhile, I built a hardware platform to realize wireless capture. [Source](https://github.com/iAaronLau/CCLivoxLOAM).
